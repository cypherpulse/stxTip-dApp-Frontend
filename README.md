### Component Architecture

The application follows a modular component architecture:

- Pages: Route-based page components (Index, NotFound)
- Components: Reusable UI components (forms, cards, buttons)
- Hooks: Custom React hooks for state and side effects
- Lib: Utility functions and blockchain interactions
- UI: Shadcn/ui component library integration

### Smart Contract Overview

The TipJar smart contract is written in Clarity and deployed on the Stacks blockchain:

- **Contract Address**: STGDS0Y17973EN5TCHNHGJJ9B31XWQ5YXBQ0KQ2Y
- **Contract Name**: tip-jar
- **Tip Function**: Allows users to send STX tips to a specified recipient
- **Owner Management**: Contract owner can withdraw accumulated tips
- **Event Logging**: Records all tip transactions for transparency
- **Security**: Built-in validation and access controls

### Key Technologies

- Frontend Framework: React 19.2.3 with TypeScript
- Build Tool: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- Styling: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- UI Components: Shadcn/ui for consistent, accessible components
- State Management: TanStack Query for server state
- Blockchain: Stacks.js for wallet and transaction handling

### Development Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run build:dev` - Build in development mode
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build

### Environment Setup

The application uses the Stacks mainnet by default. For development:

1. Ensure your wallet is connected to the appropriate network
2. Test transactions use testnet STX (no real value)
3. Smart contracts are deployed on the configured network
